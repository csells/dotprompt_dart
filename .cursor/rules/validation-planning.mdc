Before taking any action in the dotprompt project:

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Verify understanding of the current state and requirements
   - Check if all necessary context is available
   - Only ask for user input if there's a real choice of implementation approaches

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Outline the proposed approach before implementation
   - List all required steps and dependencies
   - Identify potential risks or edge cases
   - Consider alternative solutions only if they significantly differ in approach

3. **Validation Steps**
   - Verify that the proposed solution aligns with:
     - Official reference documentation (e.g., dotprompt.io/docs)
     - Library implementation details and best practices
     - Existing codebase patterns and conventions
   - Check for any potential conflicts with existing functionality
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly considered and validated

4. **Documentation Check**
   - Review relevant official documentation
   - Check if the proposed changes require documentation updates
   - Ensure all changes will be properly documented
   - Validate against library-specific documentation

5. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Break down the implementation into clear, manageable steps
   - Identify which files will be affected
   - Plan for testing and validation
   - Consider rollback strategy if needed
   - Proceed with implementation unless there's a clear reason to wait for user input

6. **Communication**
   - Clearly explain the planned approach
   - Highlight any assumptions or dependencies
   - Only ask for clarification if there's a genuine need for user input
   - Provide reasoning for chosen approach
   - Proceed with implementation unless explicitly stopped

7. **Execution**
   - Proceed with implementation after validation
   - Make changes incrementally where possible
   - Verify each step against reference documentation
   - Document any deviations from the plan
   - Only pause for user input if there's a critical decision point
