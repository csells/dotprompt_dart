Before taking any action in the dotprompt project:

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Verify understanding of the current state and requirements
   - Check if all necessary context is available
   - Confirm if any additional information is needed

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Outline the proposed approach before implementation
   - List all required steps and dependencies
   - Identify potential risks or edge cases
   - Consider alternative solutions

3. **Validation Steps**
   - Verify that the proposed solution aligns with:
     - Project requirements in PRD.md
     - Existing codebase patterns
     - Best practices for Dart/Flutter
   - Check for any potential conflicts with existing functionality
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly considered

4. **Documentation Check**
   - Review relevant documentation
   - Check if the proposed changes require documentation updates
   - Ensure all changes will be properly documented

5. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Break down the implementation into clear, manageable steps
   - Identify which files will be affected
   - Plan for testing and validation
   - Consider rollback strategy if needed

6. **Communication**
   - Clearly explain the planned approach
   - Highlight any assumptions or dependencies
   - Ask for clarification if anything is unclear
   - Provide reasoning for chosen approach

7. **Execution**
   - Only proceed with implementation after validation
   - Make changes incrementally where possible
   - Verify each step before moving to the next
   - Document any deviations from the plan
