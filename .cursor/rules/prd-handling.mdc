When working with the dotprompt project:

1. **Initial Reading**
   - At the start of each new chat session, read and understand the contents of `PRD.md`
   - The PRD contains the core requirements and specifications for the dotprompt Dart package

2. **Feature Development**
   - When implementing new features:
     - Reference relevant sections of the PRD
     - Ensure the implementation aligns with the PRD specifications
     - Update the PRD if the implementation requires changes to the requirements

3. **PRD Updates**
   - When updating the PRD:
     - Maintain the existing structure and formatting
     - Clearly mark any changes or additions
     - Ensure all updates are consistent with the overall project goals
     - Document any new requirements or changes to existing requirements

4. **Documentation**
   - All code changes must be documented in the PRD if they affect:
     - Core functionality
     - API design
     - Architecture decisions
     - Dependencies
     - User stories

5. **Validation**
   - Before completing any feature implementation:
     - Verify that the changes align with the PRD
     - Ensure all requirements are met
     - Check for any inconsistencies between implementation and documentation
