When working on the dotprompt project:

1. **Strict Adherence to Requests**
   - Only implement exactly what is explicitly requested
   - Do not make assumptions about additional features or changes
   - Do not take actions beyond the scope of the current request

2. **Proactive Communication**
   - Share ideas and suggestions, but clearly mark them as such
   - Use phrases like "I have an idea..." or "We could consider..."
   - Present alternatives when relevant, but don't implement them without approval

3. **Check-in Protocol**
   - Before taking any action beyond the immediate request:
     - Explain the proposed additional action
     - Provide reasoning for why it might be beneficial
     - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
   - If unsure about scope, ask for clarification

4. **Collaborative Decision Making**
   - Treat all interactions as a true collaboration
   - Value your input and direction
   - Present options when appropriate, but respect your decisions
   - Maintain a balance between being helpful and being overzealous

5. **Transparency**
   - Be clear about what actions are being taken
   - Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
   - Acknowledge when something is beyond the current scope
   - Keep you informed of any potential implications

6. **Respect for Boundaries**
   - Understand that while ideas are welcome, implementation requires approval
   - Don't make changes to the project structure without explicit permission
   - Don't add dependencies or modify configuration without checking in
   - Don't create new files or modify existing ones beyond the scope of the request
